Kobe Bryant contends that failure does not exist and illustrates that failure is nothing but a mere figment of imagination. Failure only happens when you refuse to keep on going and finally decide not to learn anymore. But Kobe Bryant tells us that disappointments are not failures but are necessary learning curves for growth, development, and self-improvement. The only way you will surely fail is when you decide not to progress from yesterday’s disappointments. Because what defines us is not the challenges and setbacks we face but how well we rise after falling. As the sage Confucius beautifully put it, “Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.”

I a not my mind. My mind is the memories of the known past. My mind is the sum of all perceptions of the past. I am not my mind. Weather it choses to identify with humiliation or being small or it chooses to identify with dominence and superiority. Neither are present. Weather it choses to identify with disapointment or 
accepting or allowing what happens or what others do, without active response or resistance. Or weather it wants to identify with being strong. The one who is. The self inside of me continues to show up and fight shame and fight the known perceptions of what my mind identifys as. 
You fail when you decide to not progress from the learning curves of yesterday.
